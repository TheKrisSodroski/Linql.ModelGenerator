# Linql.ModelGenerator
Model Generation for Linql. 

> This portion of Linql is a work in progress.  

## About 

[Linql](https://github.com/TheKrisSodroski/Linql) is a next-generation, language native graph api library.  This project allows you to autogenerate your models for clients. It is broken up into a Frontend/Backend architecture, where the Backend generates an intermediary language which can then be piped to the Frontend for a particular language in order to generate native models for that language.
